            Based on the design brief, desk research, and field study, the key challenges in Work Integrated Learning (WIL) programs include:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Communication gaps between students, industry partners, and academics</li>
              <li>Repetitive and time-consuming task handling</li>
              <li>Lack of meaningful and structured reflection</li>
              <li>Limited visibility into student progress</li>
            </ul>
          </>
        }
        goal="To support students in reflecting regularly during internships by making self-reflection feel light, emotionally supportive, and easy to start â€” ultimately building a sustainable and enjoyable habit."
        process="We co-designed low-pressure emoji-based prompts, created a Figma prototype, and ran user tests."
        outcome={
          <>
            The final design is a low-pressure, emotionally aware reflection system featuring:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Emoji-based mood check-ins</li>
              <li>Gentle daily prompts styled like messages from a supportive buddy</li>
              <li>A warm, minimal interface that encourages consistent use</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">
              It supports students in meaningful self-reflection while streamlining feedback for both industry and academic supervisors.
