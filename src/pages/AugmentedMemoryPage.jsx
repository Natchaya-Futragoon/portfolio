            <p>
              To explore how AR can enhance memory recall, a probe kit was created including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-2">
              <li><strong>A card deck</strong> introducing AR interaction possibilities</li>
              <li><strong>A reflective journal</strong> to imagine emotional scenarios</li>
              <li><strong>Postcards and a Polaroid</strong> to capture emotional memories</li>
              <li><strong>A scrapbook and self-letter</strong> to deepen reflection</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Participants used these tools before being interviewed, and insights were analyzed thematically.
